/**
 * HTTP/3 connection implementation.
 *
 * Wires frame parsing/serialization, QPACK, the stream manager, the
 * control-stream SETTINGS exchange, and GOAWAY over an injected
 * `@browsercore/quic` connection.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. `connectHttp3()` opens the control stream + the two QPACK streams.
 *   2. It writes a SETTINGS frame on the control stream and awaits the peer's
 *      SETTINGS (the handshake completes once it arrives, or
 *      `SettingsAckTimeoutError` fires after the configured timeout).
 *   3. `request()` opens an even-numbered bidirectional stream, sends a
 *      HEADERS frame (+ optional DATA), and resolves with the response once
 *      response HEADERS + end-of-DATA arrive.
 *
 * TODO (Steps 6–8 of PLAN.md): implement the connection lifecycle, request
 * multiplexing, and GOAWAY.
