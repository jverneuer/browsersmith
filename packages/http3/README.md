# @browsercore/http3

HTTP/3 framing + QPACK over QUIC streams.

## Responsibility

HTTP/3 frame parsing/serialization over typed QUIC streams, QPACK header
compression over unidirectional encoder/decoder streams, the control-stream
SETTINGS exchange, GOAWAY graceful shutdown, and PUSH_PROMISE / CANCEL_PUSH /
MAX_PUSH_ID handling. The package knows nothing about the underlying QUIC
transport — it could be a real QUIC connection, a pipe, or a test double.

## What it does NOT know about

- UDP / QUIC / TLS 1.3 (handled by the QUIC connection abstraction)
- TCP, DNS, or sockets
- HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2
- Browser fingerprints

## Public API

```ts
import { connectHttp3, GoawayReceivedError } from "@browsercore/http3";

const conn = await connectHttp3({ quic: quicConnection });

const res = await conn.request({
    method: "GET",
    scheme: "https",
    authority: "example.com",
    path: "/index.html",
    headers: new Map([["accept", "text/html"]]),
    body: undefined,
});

console.log(res.statusCode, res.body);
await conn.goaway(0n);
await conn.close();
```

## Types

| Export | Kind | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Http3Connection` | interface | Public contract higher layers depend on |
| `connectHttp3()` | function | Wrap a QUIC connection with HTTP/3 |
| `Http3Frame` | discriminated union | Every HTTP/3 frame variant |
| `Http3FrameType` | const object | RFC 9114 frame type ids |
| `Http3StreamType` | const object | QUIC unidirectional-stream type ids |
| `Http3Settings` | const object | RFC 9114 SETTINGS identifiers |
| `QuicConnection` | interface | Injected QUIC abstraction |
| `Http3Error` | class | Base typed error |
| `GoawayReceivedError` | class | Peer sent GOAWAY |
| `PushCancelledError` | class | Peer cancelled a push |
| `FrameParseError` | class | Malformed frame |
| `QpackDecodeError` | class | Malformed QPACK block |
| `SettingsAckTimeoutError` | class | SETTINGS ACK timed out |
| `SettingsViolationError` | class | Peer violated our SETTINGS |

## Dependency graph

```
@browsercore/http3
  └─ (no @browsercore/* dependencies — QUIC connection is injected)
```

The QUIC connection is injected — `@browsercore/http3` imports only the
`QuicConnection` *type*, never a concrete implementation. The concrete QUIC
implementation lives in a separate `@browsercore/quic` package (future) and
satisfies this interface. HTTP/3 needs no crypto of its own (QPACK is
compression-only, and there is no PING frame), so the package has no runtime
dependency on any other `@browsercore/*` package.

No other `@browsercore/*` packages are imported.
