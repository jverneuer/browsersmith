/**
 * HTTP redirect following — protocol-level capability for @browsercore/http1.
 *
 * Design note: this logic is intentionally a STANDABLE exported function and is
 * NOT wired into {@link Http1ConnectionImpl.request}. The @browsercore/fetch
 * package implements its own redirect following (and connection-pool migration
 * across origins) in `src/client.ts`. Auto-following here would double-follow
 * against fetch. Instead, `followRedirects` gives a clean, tested capability
 * that fetch (or any caller) can reuse, without changing current fetch behavior.
 *
 * Method/body rewrite follows RFC 7231:
 *   - 303 See Other   -> GET, body stripped.
 *   - 307/308         -> method + body preserved.
 *   - 301/302          -> method + body preserved (RFC-correct; browsers
 *                         historically GET-ify, but the spec does not).
