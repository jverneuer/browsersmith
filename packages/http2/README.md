# @browsercore/http2

HTTP/2 framing over any duplex byte stream.

## Responsibility

Frame parsing/serialization, HPACK header compression, stream lifecycle
management, flow control (connection + stream level), SETTINGS exchange,
GOAWAY graceful shutdown, PING, and PUSH_PROMISE handling. The package knows
nothing about the underlying transport — it could be plain TCP, TLS, a pipe, or
a test double.

## What it does NOT know about

- TLS / ALPN
- TCP, DNS, or sockets
- HTTP/1.1
- Browser fingerprints

## Public API

```ts
import { connectHttp2, GoawayReceivedError } from "@browsercore/http2";

const conn = await connectHttp2({ transport, initialSettings: { ENABLE_PUSH: 0 } });

const res = await conn.request({
    method: "GET",
    scheme: "https",
    authority: "example.com",
    path: "/index.html",
    headers: new Map([["accept", "text/html"]]),
    body: undefined,
});

console.log(res.statusCode, res.body);
await conn.ping();
await conn.close();
```

## Types

| Export | Kind | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Http2Connection` | interface | Public contract higher layers depend on |
| `connectHttp2()` | function | Wrap a transport with HTTP/2 |
| `Frame` | discriminated union | Every HTTP/2 frame variant |
| `FrameType` | const object | RFC 7540 frame type ids |
| `StreamState` | discriminated union | RFC 7540 §5.1 states |
| `FlowControlWindow` | interface | Per-stream/connection send window |
| `Http2Error` | class | Base typed error |
| `GoawayReceivedError` | class | Peer sent GOAWAY |
| `RstStreamError` | class | Peer reset a stream |
| `FlowControlError` | class | Send exceeded window |
| `FrameParseError` | class | Malformed frame |
| `SettingsAckTimeoutError` | class | SETTINGS ACK timed out |
